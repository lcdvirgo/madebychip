			name: "Ava Josephine",
			meaning: "Ava possesses the vintage Hollywood glam of screen siren Ava Gardner, plus the sleek appeal and allure of compact, modern-sounding names that speed along the popularity lists (like Mia). Ava is one of those elemental names at home in many countries, like Iran (it means “voice” in Persian). In Hebrew it’s seen as related to Chava, which means “life” or “serpent,” or could be descended from the Latin Avis, meaning “bird.” High-profile parents who’ve picked Ava include Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Jackman, Eli Manning, Mia Hamm and Jeremy Renner.",

	    {
				name: "Avery Juliet",
				meaning: "A medieval name, Avery may have magical roots connecting it to the Old English word for elf. Something of a changeling in the modern day, it has gone from primarily a boys' name to a widely popular choice for girls, shooting to the top 50 for American girls in 2007. Fans of the TV comedy 30 Rock will recall Avery Jessup, a no-nonsense reporter played by Elizabeth Banks, while music fans will remember musician Avery Barkley breaking women’s hearts on Nashville. Avery has also made many appearances in children’s fiction, with the male version popping up in Charlotte’s Web and Harry Potter.",

	    },
			{
				name: "Asher June",
				meaning: "The Puritans were among the first to dust off this biblical name and introduce it to the English-speaking world. The happy meaning, the soft falling sound of Ash at the beginning and the trendy –er at the finish have helped propel the gentlemanly Asher to become a more approachable choice. In the Bible, Asher was the eighth son of Jacob and promised a life of blessings and abundance. Today, Asher is more popular than ever, propelling its way to the top 100 and beyond.",

				name: "Amelia Juniper",
				meaning: "From pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart to Amelia Bloomer, a 19th-century women’s rights advocate, Amelia is a name that brings distinction to the bearer, unless you happen to be Minnie Driver. It’s thought to be a combination of Emilia and Amalia or the invention of novelist Henry Fielding. This charming Victorian name is seen as an alternative to the hugely popular Emily.

				name: "Alexander Jackson",
				meaning: "The defender of mankind has been in popular demand—and in the top 12—since 2005, according to Social Security Administration data.
