As former CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey recently tweeted ‚Äú[You don‚Äôt own web3 but venture capitalists do‚Äù](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098)  and  [Marc Andreessen blocked him](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/23/jack-dorsey-blocked-by-marc-andreessen-on-twitter-after-web3-comments.html)  after the Web3 comments, it is opening up discussions in the community about whether Web3 is really decentralized. However, it is undeniable that Web3 really brings fresh changes in terms of both technologies and design trends ‚Äî which is really interesting to learn for UX/UI practitioners like me. Below I present to you an awesome list of Web3 companies and hopefully give you inspirations for designing effective messaging on the web platform.

# 02 Axies Infinity
