# Well-integrated or digital walled garden?

Airpods, Gmail inline commenting, and Instagram cross-post to Facebook

Designers always get asked: “What’s your favorite app?”

Increasingly, the app that we use in daily life is no longer one singular app, but a suite of well-integrated hardware and software that seamlessly talk to each other and bring convenience to our life without us realizing it.

The devil is in the details. One might argue that big tech companies are building walled gardens of tech, that try to lure you deeper and deeper into their ecosystem. Still, in big corporates, this takes tremendous discipline to work with cross-functional teams and build a comprehensive solution after reviewing the overall customer journey and identifying the pain point and gaps that would bring value and save time for the people. Here are three examples that I have observed:

1. Gmail ↔ Google Doc  
Remember when you had to open a separate tab to read and respond to a Google Doc remark after you received it? No longer! With dynamic email, you may remark and resolve a comment directly from Gmail. The comments will be updated in the Google Doc. It is truly time-saving.

2. iPhone ↔ Airpods  
Building both hardware and software well is Apple’s competitive advantage. The delightful experience started when the Airpod shows up rotating in 3D on a bottom sheet when you are trying to connect Airpods with your iPhone. Comparing this to when you connect iPhone to other Bluetooth headphones, the system dialog pairing dialog would pop up, which is not as magical.

3. Instagram ↔ Facebook  
Sharing your stories with your friends and family (or your customers if you are running a business) couldn’t be easier by cross-posting Instagram posts or stories to Facebook. Just one tap away, and both your followers on Instagram and Facebook will be able to view the latest happenings in your life!

What are your favorite well-integrated apps? Feel free to comment below, and I’d love to hear about your experience :)
