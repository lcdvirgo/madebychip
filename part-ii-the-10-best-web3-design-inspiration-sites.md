About 2 months ago, I wrote [an article about the design inspiration of Web3 websites](https://blog.cryptostars.is/the-10-best-web3-design-inspiration-sites-b1cf5f267e0f). Since then, the article has been well received from the community. I would like to thank all the readers for giving me the support‚Äìso here is part 2 of Web3 design inspirations!

11 AKU
======

Created by former MLB (Major League Baseball) player turned digital artist [Micah Johnson](https://twitter.com/micah_johnson3) who consistently delivers quality NFTs, Aku is a young, Black digital explorer dressed as an astronaut with a helmet, chasing his dreams.

12 OpenSea
==========

As the largest game-changing decentralized marketplace, OpenSea lets users buy and sell [NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq) on the secondary marketplace, and also create their own NFT collections to sell on the primary marketplace (creator‚Äôs own website). OpenSea provides a simple interface to list, browse, and bid on tokens without interacting directly with the blockchain. But the successful traction and valuation at $13 billion in a recent funding round, OpenSea‚Äôs users were [attacked by phishing and 254 tokens were stolen](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/20/22943228/opensea-phishing-hack-smart-contract-bug-stolen-nft) on Feb 19, 2022, causing panic among the site‚Äôs users. This reveals the urgent needs of NFT marketplaces to step up their security game, such as a better signing standards (EIP-712) so people can actually see what they are doing when approving a transaction, according to [Alexander Klus on CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-phishing-scandal-reveals-a-security-need-across-the-nft-landscape).
